Notes:

To run this program you must first download the data text file externally: http://www.forextester.com/templates/data/files/EURUSD.zip

Then, open EURUSD.txt and delete the 1st line- "<TICKER>,<DTYYYYMMDD>,<TIME>,<OPEN>,<HIGH>,<LOW>,<CLOSE>,<VOL>". It will interfere with the program.

Lastly, you must place the edited EURUSD.txt under the same directory the program is in.
